# React Leaflet Editable Popup

A small plugin for leaflet which allows the author to make a popup editable. You can also use the popup to remove its source. This is adapted from [leaflet-popup-modifier](https://github.com/slutske22/leaflet-popup-modifier) to work with React-Leaflet.

See the [GitHub](https://github.com/slutske22/React-Leaflet-Editable-Popup) for more information.
